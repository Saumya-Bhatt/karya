# Components

Karya has the following components which helps it achieve its functionality. Note that **all of the components are
stateless** hence can be scaled in numbers according to your requirements without any issue.

---

## Client

Users can integrate the Karya client into their services to:

- Create a user
- Use that user to schedule tasks
- Update/cancel tasks

---

## Server

This is a web server via which the client interacts. It has the following functions:

1. Manage users. Only a registered user can schedule a task.
2. Pushes the task to the repo connector from which the scheduler will poll from

This is a configurable component as Karya will look for an environment variable `KARYA_SCERVER_CONFIG_PATH` to find the
.yml file that the scheduler instance will look for at runtime. The structure of the yml file is as follows:

| Server.yml Key             | Sample Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   |----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *application.strictMode*   | true         | This key if set *false* will allow [chained plans](./CONNECTORS.md/#chained-plans) to be recurring in nature. Note that this can lead to number of tasks being scheduled exponentially, so **proceed with caution**. |
| *application.chainedDepth* | 2            | [Chained plans](./CONNECTORS.md/#chained-plans) are nothing but recursive triggers. As such, one can specify till what depth can this chain be, by setting this variable                                             |

## Scheduler

- This is the heart of Karya. it will constantly keep polling the repo, and when it is time to execute the task, will it
  push to the queue.
- This is the component which has the logic as to when and if the next task is to be scheduled.

This is a configurable component as Karya will look for an environment variable `KARYA_SCHEDULER_CONFIG_PATH` to find
the .yml file that the scheduler instance will look for at runtime. The structure of the yml file is as follows:

| Scheduler.yml Key                     | Sample Value | Sescription                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
 |---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *application.threadCount*             | 2            | How many threads you want one instance of scheduler to use                                                                                                                                                   |
| *application.workers*                 | 3            | How many workers within the instance do you want to spin up. Useful when the throughput is high                                                                                                              |
| *application.fetcher.channelCapacity* | 10           | Executor *polls* for messages from the repo and pushes it to a local queue from which the workers consume from. This property defines the size of this queue explicitly to prevent a *OutOfMemory* scenario. |
| *application.fetcher.pollFrequency*   | 250          | Polling frequency from the repo, lesser the value, better the precision of when the task should be executed                                                                                                  |
| *application.fetcher.executionBuffer* | 1000         | This specifies how far back from the time of polling should scheduler look for an unexecuted task. This should always be higher than pollFrequency                                                           |
| *application.fetcher.repoPartitions*  | List<Int>    | From which partitions of the repo should the scheduler instance should poll from.                                                                                                                            |

## Executor

- Executors receive a task from the worker-queue and does the heavy work that the user specifies.
- User can specify what action should the executor perform once it receives the task. This is done via setting an
  environment variable `KARYA_EXECUTOR_CONFIG_PATH` that the executor will look for to initialize the connector-plugins
  at run time.
- [Connector-Plugins](./CONNECTORS.md) define what operations at the time of execution should the executor
  support.

  ```yml
  application:
   connectors:                    // this here is the list of connector-plugins and their properties that the executor should support
     - type: "restapi"            // in this example, we are configuring the executor to support a task that involves making a REST call when it has to execute
       configs:
         keepAliveTime: 3000
         connectionTimeout: 1000
         connectionAttempts: 3
  ```
